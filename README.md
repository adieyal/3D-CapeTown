# 3D-CapeTown
3D map of Cape Town complete with embedded data

Very early days but I wanted to play around with three.js and maps. It's currently quiet rough. You can click on the suburbs to get information about them. You right mouse to navigate. Left button rotates, middle wheel zooms, right button pans. You can also use the arrow keys.
